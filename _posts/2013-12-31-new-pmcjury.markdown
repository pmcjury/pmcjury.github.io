I've just started to setup my personal site. I had previoulsy used [wordpress][wordpress], but I rarely put new content on the site. Don't get me wrong, [wordpress][wordpress] is great, but I just didn't need to do much with it besdies write and basic linking. The database, site maintenance, upgrades, plugins, etc were overkill for the task at hand. I generally use wordpress for people who are not too savvy with editing content by hand, need more social content, easy editing, and who I can charge per setup/theme :)! I can't charge myself and I'm pretty savvy so...

So, as a new years resolution I've decided to start writing and sharing some content. I wanted it to be easy, no stupid bot comments spam, and no database, so [Github Pages][github-pages] was it for me. 

I write alot of markdown at work as my documentation syntax of choice within projects, so I'm going to start out using only [Jekyll][jekyll]. I'll probably end up using [Prose.io][prose-io] as well since it's also way cool for just editing the content after you've built the site. I can use [Travis][travis] to build it automagically, and boom, I gots me a site. I'm gonna stick with the bare bones [Jekyll][jekyll]. I'll check out [Octopress][octopress] later if [Jekyll][jekyll], becomes too hard. But, as I said. I want it to be easy peasy. I'm also using a pre built theme I think is pretty cool call [Hyde][hyde] :

> An elegant open source and mobile first theme for Jekyll. Made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

It's minimal, but has enough visual to still be elegant and not boring. I like it!

One of the main things I want to share is my experience in software development, and mostly focusing on _gotchas_. I routinly search for problems other people have had in order to find a quick solution to my problems. 

I ask myself two things:

> How do I fix this?

> _I don't know._

> You know who knows? 

> **_The internet!_**

When I can't find solutions on the internet I actually have to figure things out for myself. 

SUCKS! 

I usually come up with a solution, because if I didn't I would be fired, and then I go on my merry way. Lately though I have been feeling guilty for not giving back. So as a new years resolution for 2014 ( hopefully there will be no strike through for that next year and 2015 in its place instead ), I've decided to share my gotchas, caveats, and general practices of crap I do right and wrong. I'm also going to try to contribute more to open source projects like chef, chefspec, chef recipes, ruby gems, php bundles, etc.

Here goes nothing...
